# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to develop a website where UFO data can be filtered upon user search.  The search parameters include:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape (of craft)

## Results
Search UFO sightings by entering the desired lookup value as listed above and pressing enter.  

## Constructive Criticism
One drawback to this website build is the search parameters are case sensitive and will not populate is not properly cased.  Bonita will not find the result for bonita.

##### Data found uncapitalized

##### No result when capitalized

## Recommendations for future builds
It would be recommended to add functionality that can overcome the previously stated issue with capitalization.  Another helpful improvement would be for the search parameters to sense when characters are deleted.  As it stands now the user must delete previous search text and press enter in the empty box to reset the search.  

It's a nice looking site with basic functionality.  However, it will need more improvement to increase ease of use to maximize its audience.
